# Simple Bot Using Kata.ai Platform

This is an example for creating chatbot using kata.ai platform. Right now, this bot able to do following :
- Taking fake coffee order
- Giving some random advice or quote to inspire you
- I still think about other feature. Pull Request are welcome
    
I know this is a random bot, but I think that this project will be very useful to look at the (example) configuration when starting real project.

So, you can use this code without any credit. Use as you like. If you want to improve or add some features then your pull request are very welcome.
